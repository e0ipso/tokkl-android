# kenkeep Index: data-and-offline

↑ Parent: [kenkeep](../index.md)

> kenkeep navigation: the injected body above is the root index node, the top-level catalog of branches and root-level leaves. Do not expect the whole knowledge base here; descend on demand. Read the root index node, pick one or more branches whose intent and tags match your task (several branches can be relevant), and read those branch `index.md` nodes. Descend further only where the task needs it, opening only the leaves you have confirmed are relevant. Follow each leaf's `relates_to` and `depends_on` cross edges to reach related leaves in other branches. You decide how deep to go per branch.

> This index only orients you; leaves hold the durable guidance. Open at least one relevant leaf before acting.

## Conventions (how we build)
- Open [**Match Tokkl web app behavior in the account timezone**](practice-match-web-app-behavior-account-timezone.md) to learn about: Use the web app's time parsing, favorites, grouping and undo, in the account timezone read from GET /api/v9/me. #api #ui #time
- Open [**Never make Start or Stop wait for the server**](practice-never-wait-for-server-on-start-stop.md) to learn about: Taps change state on the phone at once and queue the change. The server is the source of truth, with a cache and queue, no sync engine. #offline #network #api
- Open [**Port Tokkl's TypeScript with JavaScript semantics and verbatim test cases**](practice-port-tokkl-typescript-with-javascript-semantics.md) to learn about: The Kotlin ports copy JavaScript's whitespace, rounding, Date.UTC and join rules, return null for NaN, and reuse Tokkl's test cases verbatim. #time #parsing #testing #tokkl

## Components (what exists)
- Open [**Change queue: ChangeQueue, ChangeSender, BackgroundSend and the offline picker**](map-change-queue-sends-entry-changes-in-order.md) to learn about: Entry changes land in the cache and a Room queue at once. ChangeSender sends them oldest first, once each, also from WorkManager when the network returns. #offline #cache #room #api #queue
- Open [**Offline cache and capabilities: AccountCache, HistoryWindow, CapabilitiesSource**](map-account-cache-and-capabilities.md) to learn about: One refresh reads /me with related data and /me/preferences, then fills the Room cache and the capability flags that screens read offline. #offline #cache #room #api #compatibility
- Open [**Account settings: AccountSettingsSource, AccountTime and NoDeviceZoneTest**](map-account-settings-source-and-account-time.md) to learn about: Sign-in and each refresh store timezone, week start, resolution and duration format. AccountTime gives zone and dates, never the device's. #time #api #android #settings

### #android
- Open [**Record screenshot references on tokkl-api36, in the commit that changes the look**](../testing/practice-screenshot-references-on-tokkl-api36.md) — Four classes compare every screen with PNGs in androidTest/assets/screenshots. Only tokkl-api36 renders them, and captures carry no ripple.
- Open [**Write instrumented tests that hold on API 31 and 36, with the shared helpers**](../testing/practice-instrumented-tests-on-every-api-level.md) — Skip with @SdkSuppress, never an assumption. Rules set device state. Reuse LoopbackRelay, openBarPage, SessionRule, TestAccounts.

### #parsing
- Open [**Port Tokkl's TypeScript with JavaScript semantics and verbatim test cases**](practice-port-tokkl-typescript-with-javascript-semantics.md) — The Kotlin ports copy JavaScript's whitespace, rounding, Date.UTC and join rules, return null for NaN, and reuse Tokkl's test cases verbatim.
### #queue
